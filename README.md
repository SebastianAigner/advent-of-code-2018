# Advent of Code 2018
Hi and thanks for stopping by! ðŸ¤—

In this repository, you will find my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/)!

I have decided that my main implementation language will be Kotlin this year.

You can find the individual days in the corresponding folders in `/src/main/kotlin/dayXX`.
